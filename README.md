# Google Lens Alternative

## Overview
This project is an alternative to Google Lens that implements an image similarity search using multiple approaches. The goal is to identify and compare images based on their visual and feature-based similarities. The project includes image processing, dataset fine-tuning, and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of different approaches.

## Features
- **Multiple Image Similarity Approaches**:
  - ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature matching
  - SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) feature matching
  - CNN-based feature extraction
  - Pre-trained models for deep learning-based similarity search
- **Dataset Fine-tuning**:
  - Preprocessing and augmentation to enhance retrieval accuracy
  - Dataset includes CIFAR-10 and custom image data
---

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Required libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flask/Streamlit


---

## Usage
1. Launch the application using the instructions above.
2. Upload an image through the interface.
3. The system will process the image and return the most similar images from the dataset.
4. Compare the results using different approaches.
